- Always export React components from their files. Prefer default export for pages and leaf components; named exports are fine for grouped utilities.
  - Pages in `src/pages/*` should `export default` the page component.
  - Reusable UI and layout components (e.g., `TopBar`, `BottomBar`, `GradientCard`) should be exported (default or named) and imported via `@/*` alias.
- With `verbatimModuleSyntax` enabled, import types using `import type {...} from "module"`.
  - Examples: `import type { FC } from "react"`, `import { cva, type VariantProps } from "class-variance-authority"`, `import { Toaster as Sonner, type ToasterProps } from "sonner"`.
- Keep `@/*` alias usage consistent for all internal imports.
