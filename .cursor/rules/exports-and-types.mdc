- Always export React components from their files. Always do named exports, never defaults
- With `verbatimModuleSyntax` enabled, import types using `import type {...} from "module"`.
  - Examples: `import type { FC } from "react"`, `import { cva, type VariantProps } from "class-variance-authority"`, `import { Toaster as Sonner, type ToasterProps } from "sonner"`.
- Keep `@/*` alias usage consistent for all internal imports.
- Prefer export const Component = () => {} syntax for all UI components
